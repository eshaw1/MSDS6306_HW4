##*Purpose*
###The file contained in this repository provides R Markdown code designed to demonstrate the result of the Central Limit Theorem. Two random samples of 75 and 100 observations are taken from the normal distribution. Then 1,000 bootstrapped samples are created with replacement. The same process is done using the exponential distribution. For both processes, the results demonstrate the validity of the Central Limit Theorem.
